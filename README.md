# About

A simple blogging app to get the hang of AngularJS a bit. Although I'm thinking about actually using it :)

```shell
# Run the API server.
./server/app.js

# Server assets.
# On all unrecognised routes just serve index.html.
cd client
./config.ru
```

## TODO

- Create/edit posts.
- Markdown.
